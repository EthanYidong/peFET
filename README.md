## What is this?

**peFET is a platform that makes it easy for event coordinators to manage pre event testing.**

peFET is a website that allows event coordinators (ECs) to create or upload participant lists. The website will give ECs tools to send mass messages to all participants via email, requesting that they upload an FET test through the peFET system. The website will present ECs with an overview of the status of participants’ submissions, as well as additional tools to pinpoint participants, then send more emails to remind them. Finally, the website will allow ECs to issue QR-code “tickets” to participants, and scan these QR-code tickets at the event venue to ensure that participants have done their submissions.
